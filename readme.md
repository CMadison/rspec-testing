#Using Rspec for Test-Driven Development

##Getting Started

Fork and clone this repo, and inspect the contents of the starter code. You'll see blueprints for two different classes, as well as tests in a `spec` folder for the implementation of these classes.

Implement the classes so that the tests succeed, using TDD principles.

1. Run test (test should fail)
2. Write code to try to make the test pass
3. Run test (if the test fails, return to step 1)
4. Refactor code if needed

Run `rspec` in the starter-code folder to run the tests.
